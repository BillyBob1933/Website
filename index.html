  <h1 align="center">Miscommunication</h1>

  <p>The age of information has become the age of misinformation. It is a phenomenon unmatched in danger and urgency.</p>

  <h2>The Infiltration of the Republican Party</h2>

  <p>Rogue elements of the GOP have sold their legislative services to society's highest bidder. Blinded by the once respectable doctrine of Adam Smith, it seems they have been misled by the "invisible hand."</p>

  <p>For 8-years the Republican Party has waged a bitter war--economically and psycologically--against Barack Obama and his administration. A war built upon the foundation of:</p>

  <ul>
   <li>Obama's domestic fidelity.</li>
   <li>The looming ethical and economic disaster of deficit spending.</li>
  </ul>
 
  <p>This overtly concrete foundation of war has began to crumble under the new administration. As its walls disintegrate, besieged by the tremors of Trumpism, the shroud of loyalty worn by the GOP has concomitantly begun to falter.</p>
