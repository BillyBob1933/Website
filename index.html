  <h2>The Infiltration of the Republican Party</h2>

  <p>Rogue elements of the GOP have sold their legislative services to society's highest bidder. Blinded by the once respectable doctrine of Adam Smith, it seems they have been misled by the "invisible hand."</p>

 <h3>A Black Hole of Irrationality</h3>

  <p>For 8-years the Republican Party has waged a bitter war--economically and psycologically--against Barack Obama and his administration. A war built upon the foundation of:</p>

  <ol type="1">
   <li>Obama's domestic fidelity.</li>
   <li>The looming ethical and economic disaster of deficit spending.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The extremists of the right-wing have offered their supporters with highly irrational arguments to justify actions that benefit a separate and distinct constituency of the opulent. It is this perpetual contrarianism, the dissemination of logical falsity that has altered the course of our era of information. Take, for example, the recent ban on immigration. The 7-nations now barred from entry, based upon the impetus of "national security" is not legislation that is built on constitutional pragmitism. There is no empirical evidence that illustrates "terrorists" from any of these nations have made attacks on US soil. Moreover, of the minute amount of foreign terrorist attacks upon the US, the worst was carried out from within the nation of Saudi Arabia (ironically one of the few Arab governments the US considers allies).
  </p>

  <p>This overtly concrete foundation of war has began to crumble under the new administration. As its walls disintegrate, besieged by the tremors of Trumpism, the shroud of loyalty worn by the GOP has concomitantly begun to falter.</p>
